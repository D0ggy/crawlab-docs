## Modify node information

We need to let the spider run on each node and let the host communicate with the node, so we need to know the IP address and port of the node. We need to manually configure the IP and port of the node. Click the blue view button in the 'operation' column in the 'node list' to enter the node details. The node details are as follows.

Enter the 'node IP' and 'node port' corresponding to the node on the right, and then click the 'save' button to save the node information.

In this way, we have finished the node configuration.
