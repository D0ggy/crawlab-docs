## Modify node information

We need to let the crawler run on each node and let the host communicate with the node, so we need to know the IP address and port of the node. We need to manually configure the IP and port of the node. Click the blue view button in the 'operation column' in the 'node list' to enter the node details. The node details are as follows.

On the right side, input the "node IP" and "node port" corresponding to the node, and then click the "save" button to save the node information.

In this way, we have completed the node configuration.
