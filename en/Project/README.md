## project

The project is an organizational form that can classify [crawler](../Spider/README.md) into different units. For example, the crawlers of "Baidu", "Bing" and "Google" should be classified as "search engine" crawlers, so we can create a project called "search engine", and then classify all related crawlers in it. The project is essentially a kind of classification form, which can better help us manage different categories of crawlers.
