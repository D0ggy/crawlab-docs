## Online file editing

Crawlab online file editing enables users to create, edit, rename, delete spider files on the web interface, and supports syntax highlighting and tree file directory navigation.

Common operations are as follows:

1. **Create file or directory**: right click a file or directory in the left navigation bar, select 'file' or 'directory', enter the name of the new file or directory, and click 'confirm' button;
2. **Save file**: click the green save button.
3. **Rename**: click the orange 'rename' button, enter a new name, and click 'confirm' button;
4. **Delete**: click the red 'delete' button and then click 'confirm' button.

⚠️Note: after operating on files (such as saving and creating), please wait a while for your changes to take effect, because nodes need to synchronize spiders (within 1 minute).
