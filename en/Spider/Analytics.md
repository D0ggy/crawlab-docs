## Statistical data

After running for a period of time, the spider will accumulate some statistical data, such as 'running success rate', 'number of tasks' and 'running time length'. Crawlab summarizes these metrics and presents them to developers.

To view the statistics, you only need to click the 'analysis' tab in the 'spider details' to see the spider statistics.
