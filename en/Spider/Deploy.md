## Deploy crawler

Crawlab deploys crawlers automatically. The master node synchronizes the crawler files on this node to all online nodes every 60 seconds. Therefore, after the user uploads the crawler, it only needs to wait up to 60 seconds to run the crawler task on all nodes.

Please refer to [principles - Chapter of crawler deployment](../Architecture/SpiderDeployment.md) for the principles of crawler deployment and synchronization.
