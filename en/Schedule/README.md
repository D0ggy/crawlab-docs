## Periodical Tasks

A scheduled task is a task that is executed repeatedly at a specified time. It is called 'Periodical Tasks' in English and 'Crontab' in Linux. A periodical task can be executed multiple times, while the user does not need to perform the task manually. This is very common in production environments. Periodical tasks are very useful for users who need incremental fetching or real-time data.

The periodical tasks list is updated frequently. Every time a spider is updated, deleted, created, and a periodical task is updated, deleted, and created, the periodical tasks list will be updated.
