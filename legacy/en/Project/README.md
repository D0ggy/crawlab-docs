## project

The project is an organizational form that can classify [spider](../Spider/README.md) into different units. For example, the spiders of "Baidu", "Bing" and "Google" should be classified as "search engine" spiders, so we can create a project called "search engine", and then classify all related spiders in it. The project is essentially a kind of classification form, which can better help us manage different categories of spiders.
