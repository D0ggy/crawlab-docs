## Enterprise wechat robot

If you want to enable enterprise wechat robot message notification, please ensure that you have obtained the **API Webhook** of the robot and configured the API Webhook in Crawlab. To get API Webhook, please refer to [official document](https://ding-doc.dingtalk.com/doc#/serverapi2/qf2nxq/26eaddd5). The official document may be too technical. You can also refer to this [document](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/1581170032113203380.html) to learn it. If you have any questions, please add wechat 'tikazyq1' for help.

The configuration of API Webhook is relatively easy: copy and paste the obtained API Webhook on the **settings** page to the **wechat robot Webhook** field, and click save button. Please make sure that you select "wechat robot" as the message notification channel.
