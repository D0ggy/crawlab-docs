## Message notification

Message notification can help users get the running status of the spider task in time, such as how many pieces of data are fetched when the spider is running, whether an error occurs, and the running time. With the message notification, you can ensure that your spider task will synchronize information with you at any time, so that you cna know how the grab is going.

Crawlab supports three message notification channels:

1. **[Email notification](Mail.md)**
2. **[DingTalk robot](DingTalk.md)**
3. **[Enterprise wechat robot](Wechat.md)**

Crawlab supports three message notification trigger modes:

1. **Triggered at the end of a task running**
2. **Triggered when a task has an error**
3. **Never trigger**

You can configure your notification channel and trigger mode on the **settings** page.

The message notification effect on the mobile phone is as follows.
