## Add node

The add node here actually refers to the add work node. Crawlab does not support adding nodes on the interface at present. You need to add a work node by doing corresponding operations on the server where the work node is located.

For specific operations, please refer to the  **Deployment of work nodes** of [multi node deployment chapter](../Installation/MultiNode.md).
