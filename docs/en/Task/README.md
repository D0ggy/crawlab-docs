## Task

A task is actually a grab task or a collection task. A task is associated with a spider, which also performs the execution command or collection rule specified by the spider. The captured or collected results are associated with the task, so you can view the result set of each task. The task of Crawlab is the core of the whole collection process, and the process of grabbing is related to the task, so the task is very important for Crawlab. The task is triggered by the "master node", and the "work node" receives the task through the task queue, and then executes the task on the node where it is located.
